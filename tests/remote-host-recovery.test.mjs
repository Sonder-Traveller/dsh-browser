// operator reads to diagnose a crash loop. Without isolation this file appends
// synthetic spawn/exit records (identifiable only by `electron=<node.exe>`) to
// that real log and makes its history unreadable.
//
// Module scope on purpose, not a `before()` hook: the host reads DSH_HOME when it
// writes, and a hook that runs after the first test body would already be too
// late. The temp directory simply outlives the process.

/**
 * Regression for issue #5: after the browser host dies (crash, or the DSH
 * process that spawned it was restarted), an ALREADY-MATERIALIZED view
 * handle used to fail forever with "browser host is not running" — the cached
 * materialization stayed bound to the dead child, so no operation could ever
 * trigger a restart. Only a brand-new view (new session / browser_reset_session)
 * recovered. The fix: a dead-host failure drops the cached materialization,
 * rebuilds the view against a freshly spawned child, and retries the
 * operation once — so surviving sessions self-heal on their first call.
 *
 * The child is a plain-Node fixture speaking the same RPC protocol as
 * host-main.js (see ./fixtures/fake-host-child.mjs), so this runs without an
 * Electron binary or display.
